In this tutorial, we will introduce the core methods for setting up and running a VERTEX simulation, and recording LFPs from the network. VERTEX is designed to facilitate the simulation of extracellular potentials generated by activity in spiking neural networks; in particular, spatially-organised networks containing thousands or hundreds of thousands of neurons. VERTEX’s interface and model specification options were designed with this particular task in mind. It is therefore less flexible than other neural simulators (e.g. NEURON, NEST, Brian, GENESIS, Moose), but the limited scope has allowed us to simplify the user interface so that a simulation can be specified simply by setting some parameters and run using a few function calls. The parameters are divided into five categories: neuron group properties, connectivity & synapses, tissue properties, recording settings, and simulation settings. The parameters associated with each category are specified in Matlab structures or structure arrays.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the different parameter settings for creating a single group of neurons that synapses with itself.

Before we start though, we’ll quickly go through VERTEX’s built-in help features.

If you need a list of all the functions available to you in VERTEX, you can run the vertexFunctions() function, which prints all available functions with a brief description of what they do:
